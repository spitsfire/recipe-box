Do not remove lid or stir the sugar mixture or it will begin to crystallize. The glass lid is a convenient way of watching the sugar so you know when it changes color as well as keeping the steam inside and preventing crystallization.</li><li>When the sugar begins to look caramelized watch it carefully and remove from heat when it reaches deep amber color. Be very careful as the sugar is extremely hot and also watch that it doesn't burn. It can go from amber to burnt very quickly.</li><li>Immediately off the heat pour the one cup cream into the caramel. The caramel will stiffen, sizzle and splatter so be careful. Return to a medium heat and cook until the caramel melts together with the cream.</li><li>Pour the caramel cream into the coffee and refrigerate until cold.</li><li>To assemble, fill a glass with ice, scoop two ice cream scoops into each glass.</li><li>Pour the iced espresso cream over and top with sweetened whipped cream (the other cup of cream whipped with 1 tablespoon sugar).</li><li>Garnish with caramel syrup and serve chilled.</li></ol>",

            step: "Place 1 cup sugar and water in a 2 quart pot with a glass lid. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Do not remove lid or stir the sugar mixture or it will begin to crystallize. The glass lid is a convenient way of watching the sugar so you know when it changes color as well as keeping the steam inside and preventing crystallization.When the sugar begins to look caramelized watch it carefully and remove from heat when it reaches deep amber color. Be very careful as the sugar is extremely hot and also watch that it doesn't burn. It can go from amber to burnt very quickly.Immediately off the heat pour the one cup cream into the caramel. The caramel will stiffen, sizzle and splatter so be careful. Return to a medium heat and cook until the caramel melts together with the cream.",

      "Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or dutch oven to 365 degrees F.\nSeparate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.\nDip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. This will help the batter adhere.\nGently beat the egg and buttermilk into the flour mixture using hand mixer.\nDip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up.\nPlace the bread and panko crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat.\nGive it a gentle tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.I suggest completing this entire step before starting to fry rings. Its very easy to burn them if youre distracted. I may or may not be speaking from experience.\nDeep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. They should float to the top immediately  if they dont your oil is not hot enough. Turn rings over once during the frying time.\nRemove form oil and transfer to a paper towel to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve warm.\nPreparing Dipping Sauce: Mix Sriracha Chili and Crema thoroughly until completely blended. Use more or less of the chili sauce depending on your heat preference.",

      "<ol><li>Preheat oven to 375F with the rack in middle position.</li><li>Make the Scone Mix.</li><li>Using a Food Processor fitted with a steel knife blade: Place half the butter and half the dry ingredients in the bowl. Pulse until the butter is reduced to pea-sized pieces, with dough still dry. Transfer first half of the mix into a large bowl. Repeat process with the other half of the ingredients and add to the large bowl.</li><li>By hand: Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and use a pastry cutter to incorporate the butter into the dough. Cut by pressing on butter, then gathering flour onto it in two quick strokes.  Cut until butter slices become pea-sized.</li><li>Dont over process or mix. Dough will be dry. Break large lumps of butter by hand, and toss dry dough with your fingers.</li><li>Blend the cheeses, dill, shallot and pepper with the Scone Mix using a wooden spoon. Drizzle the buttermilk over the dough and drop the cottage cheese in the middle, and stir until mixed. Add more buttermilk if dough is too dry to hold together.</li><li>Place dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into two. Form 2 discs and flatten each to a thickness of about 1-1/2 inches, cut into 6 wedges for a total of 12. Arrange an inch apart on a cookie sheet.</li><li>Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, until scones are light brown on top and darker at the bottom. Bread should no longer be soft and doughy in the center. Bake in 2 batches if scones dont fit in one cookie sheet.</li><li>Serve warm or cool in a wire rack before wrapping in foil or plastic wrap/bag. Freshly baked scones can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days, and in the refrigerator for a week.</li></ol>",
